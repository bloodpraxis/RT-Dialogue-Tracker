You need to do this or the difference will not load. Why? The machine spirit demands so.

4. Pick the language you want to compare. Currently, enGB and ruRU are available. 

5. Click "Load diff". Additionally, choose "Split" or "Unified" view mode. Pay attention to the URL. Make sure there's still only two dots between versions.

6. Profit.
