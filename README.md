## Do it Yourself - Quick start

**Note:** It is possible that the webpage will not show you the differences due to them being too large (for example comparing earliest with latest version). 

1. Go to [this link](https://github.com/bloodpraxis/RT-Dialogue-Tracker/compare)
2. Pick the game version you want to compare

3. Look at the link URL on your address bar.

You need to do this or the difference will not load. Why? The machine spirit demands so.

4. Pick the language you want to compare. Currently, enGB and ruRU are available. 

5. Click "Load diff". Additionally, choose "Split" or "Unified" view mode. Pay attention to the URL. Make sure there's still only two dots between versions.

6. Profit.


## Do it Yourself - Alternate method

If you have git, clone the repo to your local machine and use ```git diff```

Alternatively, you can download individual files from its branches and use something like [WinMerge](https://winmerge.org/?lang=en) to compare them on your own local machine.
